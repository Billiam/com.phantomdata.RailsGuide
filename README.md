# What is this?

This is a small static site designed to help ease brand new developers into the world of Rails.  Please feel free to check out the project and contribute through pull requests.

# Running the project

I wanted this project to be very simple.  Its really just a collection of markdown documents inside the 'sections' folder.  You can run the included `build.rb` to build the files into the final static site.  You'll need to run bundle install, but you should be good to go.

`git clone`
`bundle install`
`watch -d bundle exec ruby ./build.rb`
