# RUnning the project

I wanted this project to be very simple.  Its really just a collection of markdown documents inside the 'sections' folder.  You can run the included `build.rb` to build the files into the final static site.  You'll need to run bundle install, but you should be good to go.

On a Linux system and don't want to recompile after every change?

`watch -d bundle exec ruby ./build.rb`
